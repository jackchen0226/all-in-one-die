## Status

All aspects are currently being developed, reviewed, and tested.

## Overview

All-in-One-Die is an extra-large die that you can shake with your own two hands! Large enough to be larger than your average d6 or d20, and it ‘rolls’ when you shake it. Additionally, when a 1 is rolled, an extremely negative sound will be played. This is for those who enjoy tabletop gaming and want a fun novelty item that is interactive.

Not family-friendly may involve swearing

## Documentation

Will be included upon completion.
