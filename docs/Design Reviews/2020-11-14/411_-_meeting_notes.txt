team 3 

overview:
project is for tabletop gaming and the device is houses a screen and a dial on side to select
the type of die you want to roll so you can go 4 8 12 20, shake it, and it displays and and you have option to roll again or select diff

block diagram:
sensor: - lis3dh accelorometer set right now to high sensitivity, someone could set off false rolls, and a potentiometer for the button
	we didn't want to use buttons on the device, all functionality is broken into the potentiometer and the timing
Andy: i like that - thought to the UX

actuator: - with the sensor reading botht the shake and pot setting, it displays onto an oled screen - 128*32 screen, you can include messages (andy asked about messages) andrew - put skull and cross bones on it, hahahah
oled is output - other output is the buzzer for a nat 1, sound,
the controller atmega32
power supply - batteries - 4 AAs (6 volts into 5 volts)


Mini Design Review:
Devon sharing screen: the schematic overview - 
looking at power first - 2 parts, the dc female to take in power with 5v regulator, power led to show that we are getting proper power, added 3.3v for the accelormeter to conver down
	and: good job on the 5v - burn less power
		few things: what is ic1 - no value associated with it - voltage regulator we pulled off of mouser 7805? use value command so it's not just a black box - no black boxes
				lm1117 - it's got a vout, input, adj/gnd and output - the datasheet uses 4 pins but table only shows the 3 pins, 3.3v output - the tab on the transistor - vout
			we will plug batteries into that - putting the diode in there is good
			usb to serial: it's adorable - stick with low power module, miniusb port, good job on shield for capacitor to gnd, rx goes to rx - yup that's wrong, on a UART rx goes to tx, and tx goes to rx, know it and connect appropraitely
			crystal resonator is fine - good job on the bypass caps
			icsp - we gett to program it, arduino ecosystem, reset goes to left to reset the dtr thing - the lcd goes to some pins and that's 5v as well, the lcd 5v in/out? not super verified, but we have been using 5v
			Accelerometer: have a jumper that is being used as test point, incase we need to use an external, this could be a pain cause small
			WE NEED BYPASS CAPS 100nF whereever there is vdd (at least 2), any single chip that is off in space need local charge resovoirs
			using spie mode- great
			not sure we want to ground chip-select, in spie mode it needs to go to output for the chip select, cs tied to pin on arduino - we need taht, spie requires cs to go from high to low to start process
			strongly suggest test points on unused pins on microcontrollera nd accelerometer
			driving buzzer directly which is probably okay - we proabbly need to have a jumper in our buzzer so we can disconnect it when we are programming it - 0 ohm resistor or something so we can program without the buzzer in place
			run erc - interuupt pins can go to test points - or not, up to us - and then we have std power warnings that we can approve
			excellent - good schematic

		layout: all fired
			gnd plane on both sides - good
			change dimensions to different layer - they are currently copper 
			power is thick - nice
			team number needed ece411-tx-xxx (follow instructions completely)
			current goal is make board
			where is usb connector? - we have type b connector oop - it'll work, just giant
			really really good
			clean up team name layer 
			dis -tval
			more to clean up but fine
			last thing need to do - staple your board, add gnd vias every 1/2 in or so, us via cmd, via 'gnd' - put those everywhere so ground works well - in places where gnd signal cut in pieces - more the merrier
			drc - air wires and stuff to fix, make sure all are clear and we are good.
